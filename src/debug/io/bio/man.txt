The general format of a TCP protocol line is:
              src > dst: Flags [tcpflags], seq data-seqno, ack ackno, win window, urg urgent, options [opts], length len
       Src  and  dst  are  the  source and destination IP addresses and ports.  Tcpflags are some combination of S (SYN), F
       (FIN), P (PUSH), R (RST), U (URG), W (ECN CWR), E (ECN-Echo) or `.' (ACK), or `none' if no  flags  are  set.   Data-
       seqno  describes  the  portion  of  sequence space covered by the data in this packet (see example below).  Ackno is
       sequence number of the next data expected the other direction on this connection.  Window is the number of bytes  of
       receive  buffer space available the other direction on this connection.  Urg indicates there is `urgent' data in the
       packet.  Opts are TCP options (e.g., mss 1024).  Len is the length of payload data.
