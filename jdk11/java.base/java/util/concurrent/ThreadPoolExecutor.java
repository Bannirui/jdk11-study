/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 *
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * if fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  Else if fewer than maximumPoolSize threads are running, a
 * new thread will be created to handle the request only if the queue
 * is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize the same, you
 * create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting maximumPoolSize to an
 * essentially unbounded value such as {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you
 * allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary number of concurrent
 * tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool sizes are set only
 * upon construction, but they may also be changed dynamically using
 * {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads, but
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.
 *
 * <li>If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.
 *
 * <li>If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li><em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the handler
 * throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon rejection.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.)
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 *
 * <p>If hook, callback, or BlockingQueue methods throw exceptions,
 * internal worker threads may in turn fail, abruptly terminate, and
 * possibly be replaced.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Reclamation</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads may be reclaimed (garbage collected)
 * without being explicitly shutdown. You can configure a pool to
 * allow all unused threads to eventually die by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = true;
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void resume() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = false;
 *       unpaused.signalAll();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }

public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {

     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see

     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
     * executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
     *
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
